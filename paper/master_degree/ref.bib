  abstract  = {Automated machine learning (AutoML) greatly eases human efforts in architecture engineering. However, mainstream AutoML methods like neural architecture search (NAS) are customized for well-designed search spaces wherein promising architectures are densely distributed. In contrast, AutoML-Zero builds machine-learning algorithms using basic primitives and can explore novel architectures beyond human knowledge. AutoML-Zero shows the potential to deploy machine learning systems by not taking advantage of either feature engineering or architectural engineering. In its current form, it only optimizes a single objective like accuracy and has no mechanism to ensure that the constraints of real-world applications are satisfied. We propose a multi-objective variant of AutoML-Zero called MOAZ, that distributes solutions on a Pareto front by trading off accuracy against the computational complexity of the machine learning algorithm. In addition to generating different Pareto-optimal solutions, MOAZ can effectively explore the sparse search space to improve search efficiency. Experimental results on linear regression tasks show MOAZ reduces the median complexity by 87.4\% compared to AutoML-Zero while accelerating the median target performance achievement speed by 82\%. In addition, our preliminary results on non-linear regression tasks show the potential for further improvements in search accuracy and for reducing the need for human intervention in AutoML.},

  abstract   = {In this paper we present an intermediate program representation, called the program dependence graph (PDG), that makes explicit both the data and control dependences for each operation in a program. Data dependences have been used to represent only the relevant data flow relationships of a program. Control dependences are introduced to analogously represent only the essential control flow relationships of a program. Control dependences are derived from the usual control flow graph. Many traditional optimizations operate more efficiently on the PDG. Since dependences in the PDG connect computationally related parts of the program, a single walk of these dependences is sufficient to perform many optimizations. The PDG allows transformations such as vectorization, that previously required special treatment of control dependence, to be performed in a manner that is uniform for both control and data dependences. Program transformations that require interaction of the two dependence types can also be easily handled with our representation. As an example, an incremental approach to modifying data dependences resulting from branch deletion or loop unrolling is introduced. The PDG supports incremental optimization, permitting transformations to be triggered by one another and applied only to affected dependences.},
